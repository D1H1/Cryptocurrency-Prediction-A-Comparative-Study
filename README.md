Cryptocurrency Prediction: A Comparative Study of Forecasting Models
This repository contains an in-depth academic exploration into the world of cryptocurrency price prediction, forecasting 1-day ahead using various time-series analysis methods. The project aims to compare the effectiveness of four prominent forecasting techniques, namely:

- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A specialized recurrent neural network architecture that is well-suited to learn from the long-term dependencies of time-series data.
- Prophet: Developed by Facebook, Prophet is a robust forecasting tool for handling daily observations that may contain missing data and incorporates seasonal effects.
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A statistical approach that models time series data based on its past observations and prediction errors.
- Exponential Smoothing: This method involves the prediction of future values based on the weighted averages of past observations, giving more importance to recent data.

Project Highlights
Data Processing and Visualization: Comprehensive preprocessing and explorative analysis of historical cryptocurrency data, ensuring quality and relevance for predictive modeling.
Model Training and Evaluation: Implementation and fine-tuning of LSTM, Prophet, ARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing models, followed by rigorous evaluation and comparison.
One-Day Ahead Forecasting: All models are employed to predict cryptocurrency prices one day into the future, providing valuable insights for short-term investment strategies.
Comparative Analysis: A systematic comparison of the models, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for different scenarios in cryptocurrency price prediction.
Usage and Collaboration
This project is designed to be both a practical tool for cryptocurrency traders and a valuable resource for researchers and students in the fields of finance and machine learning. Contributions, feedback, and collaboration are warmly welcomed.
